I want to improve this smart contract. 

But Iâ€™m not sure what I want, so I want you to show me what changes each idea would create on the smart contract, and also offer your own ideas on how to improve the contract.

Show me change individually, and then I will tell you what to implement
1. I want to have additional layers of referral incentive, NBA able to set an arbitrary limit to the number of incentives on a chain, as well as the additional invite points which are added for each level recursively

2. I want to integrate the following reward series from @integer-series.hpp which will 
adjust or just add to the owed reward that the user has for their current invite points.
